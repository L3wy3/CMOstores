Hello,
thanks for taking the time to review my application,

Responsivly my main objective was to get all three rows onto a 320px screen, Styling with bootstrap was a bit of a pain it's been a while so I resorted to custom css, I've been using tailwind for a while now so I've forgotton the bootstrap versions but I think my strengh is adaptablility and eagerness to learn new skills, it wouldn't take me long to get back in to the swing of your tech stack seeing I've used it all at some point or another

API wise I could do with some practice, I wasted far too much time trying to work out why I couldn't switch between ascending and descending 

I'd love to share my experience from Sykes, I think the CRO mindset I developed can be very useful

Thanks again,
Laurence
